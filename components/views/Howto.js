    <h1>OutLine Of Content:</h1>
    <h4>What do I want on each page? (text / pics / images / navigation)</h4>
    <p>
      I will be using CSS handle navigation, Pictures will be used on create
      page as the My navigation will be coded Css, Pics are minimal but subject
      to change. I have a company logo to add, I will need a punch card that has
      a qr code attached to it.

    <h4>What do I want the functionality of each page to be?</h4>

        place to send a group message via email to all contacts stored

      <h2>List what you like about each site:</h2>
      <p>All the information that I received helped give me the structure on how to lay out my project and even though it can become very complex I have to make it as simple as possible because I have to think about the knowledge of the consumer and The Business owner who would be operating the web app.</p>

      <h2>List what you do not like about each site:</h2>
      <p>The fact that there are so many different ways to create a loyalty program it was hard to decide which way to go. And the fact that the qr code is essential and probably hardest part to figure out</p>
